 Palindrome-Birthday Check is a fun game app created using Vanilla JS to check is your birthday is palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word/number which reads the same backward as forward. This app checks your birthdate in all date formates.
 
 
 ## How it works

- Takes user's birthday.
- Tells them whether they was born on a palindrome date or not.
- If not a palindrome, then it tells users what is the nearest date from their birthdate which is a palindrome date.
- It also tells them by how many days they missed it.
